### 1. Rest Timers

- **Description:** Integrate a rest timer that automatically starts after a set is completed. The timer duration could be configurable in the settings or on a per-exercise basis.
- **Benefit:** This is a crucial feature for serious lifters who want to control their rest periods for optimal performance and hypertrophy. It removes the need for a separate timer app.

### 2. Detailed Workout History & Analysis

- **Description:** A more detailed workout history page. Instead of just a list of completed workouts, users could click on a past workout to see the full details (exercises, sets, reps, weight).
- **Benefit:** Allows users to easily review their past performance, which is essential for progressive overload. The current history is very basic.

### 3. Exercise-Specific Progress Charts

- **Description:** On the `ExerciseLibrary` page, allow users to click on an exercise to see a detailed history and progress chart for that specific lift. This would be more detailed than the 1RM chart on the dashboard. It could show volume, max weight lifted, and rep PRs over time.
- **Benefit:** Provides a much more granular view of progress for each lift, helping users identify plateaus or see long-term trends.

### 4. Warm-up Set Generator

- **Description:** For the first exercise of a workout, automatically generate a warm-up sequence based on the first working set's weight. For example, 5 reps at 50%, 3 reps at 70%, 1 rep at 85%.
- **Benefit:** Proper warm-ups are essential for injury prevention and performance. Automating this would be a great convenience for users.

### 5. Integrated Plate Calculator

- **Description:** The current plate calculator is a separate tool. It could be integrated directly into the `WorkoutPlanner` interface. When a user sees their target weight, there could be a button to instantly show the plate breakdown.
- **Benefit:** This would make the plate calculator much more useful and seamless to use during a workout.

### 6. Supersets and Circuits

- **Description:** Allow users to group exercises into supersets (two exercises back-to-back) or circuits (multiple exercises in a row).
- **Benefit:** This is a common training technique, and the current app structure (one exercise at a time) doesn't support it.

### 7. Personal Records (PRs)

- **Description:** A dedicated section to track personal records for different rep ranges (1RM, 3RM, 5RM, etc.) for each exercise. The app could automatically detect and notify the user when they've hit a new PR.
- **Benefit:** PRs are a huge motivator for lifters. Tracking them automatically would be a very satisfying feature.

### 8. Deload Week Generator

- **Description:** Add a feature to generate a "deload" week, where the volume and/or intensity of the user's current plan is reduced.
- **Benefit:** Deloads are an important part of long-term training to allow for recovery. Automating this would help users program their training more effectively.

### 9. Workout Notes

- **Description:** Add a simple text field to each workout session and/or each exercise within a session for users to add notes (e.g., "Felt strong today," "Slight pain in my shoulder," "Try a different grip next time").
- **Benefit:** This qualitative data can be very useful for understanding the context of a workout and making adjustments in the future.
