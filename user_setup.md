LevelUp Tracker: Setup and User Guide

Welcome to LevelUp Tracker! This guide will walk you through setting up the application for the first time and explain how to use its features to create personalized workout plans, track your progress, and reach your fitness goals.
Part 1: Initial Setup (First Use)

When you first load the application, it automatically creates a secure, anonymous account for you and sets up a default user profile. To get the most out of the app, your first step should be to personalize this profile.

    Navigate to Settings: On the main dashboard, look for the gear icon (<Settings />) in the top-right corner. Click it to go to the Settings page.

    Your User ID: You'll notice your unique User ID displayed on the dashboard. This is your anonymous identifier in the system.

Part 2: Configuring Your Profile (The Settings Page)

The Settings page is where you'll tell the app about your goals and the equipment you have. This is the most important step for ensuring the workout generator creates plans that are right for you.

    Set Your Profile:

        Fitness Goal: Choose between Strength, Hypertrophy (Muscle Growth), or Endurance. This will determine the set and rep schemes in your generated workouts.

        Fitness Level: Select Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced. This helps tailor the complexity and volume of the workouts.

    Select Available Equipment:

        Tap on the buttons for each piece of equipment you have access to (e.g., Barbell, Dumbbells, Squat Rack).

        Selected equipment will be highlighted in blue.

        Why this is important: The workout generator will only include exercises you can actually perform with the equipment you've selected.

    Manage Your Weight Plates:

        This section is for the Plate Calculator tool.

        To Add Plates: Enter the weight of a single plate (e.g., 45 lbs) and the quantity you own (e.g., 2). Click "Add Plates".

        To Remove Plates: Click the trash icon next to any plate entry.

        Why this is important: The calculator uses this inventory to tell you exactly how to load the barbell for a specific weight.

    Save Your Changes:

        Once you're done, click the "Save All Changes" button at the bottom. Your profile is now ready!

Part 3: Generating a Workout Plan

With your profile set up, you can now create a custom workout plan.

    Go to the Generator: From the dashboard, click the "New Plan" or "Generate Your First Plan" button.

    Choose Your Parameters:

        Days per week: Use the slider to select how many days you want to work out.

        Workout Split: Choose your preferred training style (e.g., Full Body, Push/Pull/Legs).

    Generate: Click the "Generate Workout" button. The app will create a multi-day plan based on your profile and selections and take you back to the dashboard to see it.

Part 4: Using the App Day-to-Day
Starting and Performing a Workout

    Select a Workout: On the dashboard, you'll see your new plan. Click the "Start Workout" button for the day you want to complete.

    Follow the Workout Player:

        The player will show you one exercise at a time.

        For each set, perform the exercise and then click the "Complete" button.

        If you used a different number of reps or weight, click the Edit icon (<Edit />), enter your actual numbers, and click Save (<Save />) before completing the set.

    Give Feedback for Progressive Overload:

        After all sets for an exercise are done, you'll be asked "How did that feel?".

        Too Easy: The app will increase the weight for this exercise in your next workout.

        Just Right: The weight will stay the same.

        Too Hard: The weight will be slightly reduced for next time.

        This feedback is key to ensuring you are continuously challenged.

    Finish: Once you complete all exercises, the workout is logged to your history. You can also finish early by clicking the button at the bottom.

Using the Plate Calculator

    Open the Tool: On the dashboard, click the "Plate Calculator" button under "Tools".

    Enter Weights: Input your desired Target Weight and confirm the Barbell Weight (defaults to 45 lbs).

    Calculate: The tool will display a visual of the barbell and tell you exactly which plates from your inventory to load on each side.

Part 5: Tracking Your Progress

The dashboard is your central hub for seeing how you're doing.

    Progress Overview: This chart shows your total volume (sets x reps x weight) for recent workouts, giving you a quick visual of your performance over time.

    Workout History: This section lists your completed workouts. Click "View Full History" to open a modal with detailed logs of every session.
